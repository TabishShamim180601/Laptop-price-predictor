1. Laptop price prediction on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
2. Performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and model training.
3. Trained linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, knn, decision tree, svm, random forest, extra tree regressor, ada boost, xg boost, gradient boost, voting regressor and stacking regressor models.
4. For each model, calculated the r2 score and mean absolute error (MAE).
5. Got best results with voting regressor (r2-0.89 and mae-0.15).
